# SQLite Database Management with Python

This project demonstrates how to build and manage a lightweight relational database using **Python** and **SQLite**. It's a simple and effective setup commonly used in desktop applications, mobile devices, and lightweight server-side systems.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for scripting and database interaction.
- **SQLite**: File-based, lightweight DBMS used to store and manage relational data.
- **SQL**: Used to query and manipulate the database.
- **pandas** *(external)*: For cleaner and more efficient CSV handling.
- **Python Standard Library modules**:
  - `sqlite3`: Interface for SQLite databases.
  - `pathlib`: For filesystem path management.
  - `csv` *(optional)*: Built-in CSV file reader (can be replaced by `pandas`).
  - `uuid` *(optional)*: For generating unique IDs.
